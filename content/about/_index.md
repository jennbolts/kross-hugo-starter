Iâ€™m Jenna, a digital designer with a side passion for print. The past five years have been spent working across tech and public sector industries on projects ranging from food based digital publishing to miniature games that run inside ad units on your phone.

For several years I have been working with both client and agency closely designing and building ads for mobile, tablet and desktop. Using CSS2 and javascript, the ethos of the creative team at Blis is to create better quality ad content and thus bring about the death of the dreaded ad blocker. Our designs are well crafted and relevant and we aim to make the ad experience a positive one for the viewer. This role required a strong working capability in building for browser, and surprisingly a great deal of video editing and animation skills.

Aside from my day-to-day ad building responsibilities, I also produced the monthly Creative Newsletter that my team has been sending within the company since January of 2016. I designed and built the landing page for our Creative services on the main company website and produced the videos featuring the campaigns we produced using After Effects.

In my spare time I am a crafter of paintings, drawing and jewellery alongside learning C# to build games in Unity.
